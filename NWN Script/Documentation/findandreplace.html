<a href="images/findandreplace.jpg"><img src="images/findandreplace-sml.jpg" style="float: right;"/></a><br />
The find and replace tool can be used for finding like entries in your script and replacing them with a supplied alterative.<br />
<br />
To open the find and replace window you will either have to select the Find and Replace option from the Edit tab on the Menubar 
located at the top of the application, or you can use the shortcut key Ctrl + H.<br />
<br />
To find and replace enter your query in the "Find What:" textbox then supply a replacement in the "Replace With:" textbox. 
Once you have completed these steps you can start replacing your text.<br />
<h3>Replace</h3>
The replace button will find and replace all the first matched entry with the replacement text supplied.<br />
<h3>Replace All</h3>
The replace all button will find and replace all of the matched entries with the replacement text supplied.<br />
If you select the "In selection" checkbox the text will only be replaced inside the currently selected text.<br />
