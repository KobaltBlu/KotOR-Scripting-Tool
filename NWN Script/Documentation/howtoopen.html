<h2>How to open a file</h2>
<p>
<a href="images/menubar.jpg"><img src="images/menubar-sml.jpg" /></a><br />
To open a file navigate to the menu bar at the uppermost part of the application. 
From the menu bar select the File button and in the dropdown menu select the Open option. 
When the openfile window appears navigate to the directory your script is located in and open it.<br />
<br />

<b>Note*</b> you can also open compiled .NCS files in the program. They will be decompiled by nwnnsscomp then saved as a temp file until you save it.<br /> At this time full decompile back to read to recompile code is not availible in this application in future versions I hope to be able to include that functionality.
