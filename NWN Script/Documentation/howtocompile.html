<h2>How to compile</h2>
<p>
<a href="images/menubar.jpg"><img src="images/menubar-sml.jpg" /></a><br />
Once you have saved your file you will want to eventually compile it so you can use it in game.<br />
To compile you will need to either select the compile option from the File menu or select the 
Quick Compile button toward the bottom right hand side of the screen.<br />
<br />

<b>Note*</b> currently you must save your script before you can compile, so nwnnsscomp.exe can have a source file to compile.
