# KotOR-Scripting-Tool
My attempt at a GUI interface for nwnnsscomp.exe for KotOR I and KotOR II

The tool has many useful features to try and make the scripting process a lot easier. Hope you find it usefull
 
**Features Include:**
- Compile & Decompile Scripts (Powered by nwnnsscomp.exe)
- Syntax highlighting
- AutoComplete Suggestions (Beta)
- Tabbed Text Editor
- Advanced Find & Replace
- Browsable nwscript functions list
- Browsable nwscript constants list
 
Future things I would like to include are full decompile capability, and Autocomplete for functions and constants.
 
I am using Fred Tetra's version of nwnnsscomp.exe therefor it should be compatible with both kotor & tsl. Just a note I have only tried Kotor atm. If you have tsl installed it shoould work though.
